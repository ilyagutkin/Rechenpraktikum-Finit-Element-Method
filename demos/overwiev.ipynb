    "\n",
    "Once you have gained a basic understanding of how to solve scalar-valued PDEs, you may be interested in addressing vector-valued problems such as the Stokes equations, the linearised Navier–Stokes equations, or even the unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The codebase also provides tools and solvers for these vector-valued PDEs.  \n",
    "To get familiar with vector spaces, you can start with the example file  \n",
    "[vectorspaces](/demos/Vectorspace.ipynb),  \n",
    "which contains a detailed explanation of how vector-valued finite element spaces (FES) are constructed and how they can be used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central objective in this project is to solve the **linearised Navier–Stokes equations** using different finite element strategies.  \n",
    "We will observe that, depending on the chosen discretization, **additional stabilization techniques** may be required to obtain accurate and stable solutions.  \n",
    "The mathematical background for these stabilizations can either be found in the literature referenced in the `README`, or—if one is feeling adventurous—accepted on faith in the author.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory  \n",
    "[Navier-Stokes](/demos/linearised_Navier_Stokes/)  \n",
    "contains two solvers:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- a **P1–P1** formulation, and  \n",
    "- a **P2–P1** formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to demonstrate that for convection-dominated problems, **additional stabilization is essential**.  \n",
    "A more complete implementation and analysis of these stabilized formulations is planned for the near future.\n"

    "#### Convection-dominated scalar problems\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the previous chapter, we generally expect numerical instabilities in the convection-dominated regime of the linearised Navier–Stokes equations.  \n",
    "This expectation is well-supported by both mathematical analysis and numerical evidence.\n",

    "To understand these difficulties in a simpler setting, it is helpful to first study the time-dependent **convection–diffusion** equation.  \n",

    "\n",
    "These examples are intended to give the reader an intuitive understanding of how such PDEs are formulated and assembled in space–time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more interesting mathematical behaviour appears in the two additional examples in this directory.  \n",
    "Here, the limitations of the standard continuous Galerkin (CG) approach become clearly visible, and the positive effect of stabilization techniques becomes immediately apparent.  \n",
    "This can be seen most clearly in the  \n",
    "[convection-dominated example](/demos/convection-diffusion/con-dominated-problem-case_2d.ipynb),  \n",
    "which also contains a helpful visualisation demonstrating the severity of the numerical issues and how stabilization improves the solution quality.\n"
