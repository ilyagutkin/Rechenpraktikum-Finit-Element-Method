    "# Introduction to the Finite Element Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of the most popular and powerful numerical strategies for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).  \n",
    "At its core, FEM is built upon two fundamental ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Domain decomposition.**  \n",
    "The computational domain $\\Omega$, on which the PDE is defined, is subdivided into many smaller subdomains called *finite elements*.  \n",
    "This subdivision  \n",
    "– allows accurate approximation of complex geometries,  \n",
    "– enables efficient resolution of local phenomena,  \n",
    "– provides a structured representation of the approximate solution.  \n",
    "The collection of all elements forms an *admissible triangulation* of $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Variational formulation.**  \n",
    "The PDE is rewritten as a *variational* (weak) problem.  \n",
